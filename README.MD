## What's This Magic? ✨

Ever wanted to dig through internet history without looking like a robot on a mission? This tool lets you explore Wayback Machine archives like a digital archaeologist with good manners (and some clever tricks up its sleeve).

## Features That Make You Look Smart 🧠

### 🎯 The Usual Suspects
- **Historical Scooping** - Get that sweet, sweet archived data
- **Multi-Mode Magic** - 4 ways to ask the same question differently
- **Subdomain Safari** - Find all those hidden digital corners
- **File Detective** - Spot config files, backups, and other internet treasures

### 🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Mode Activated
- **Polite Knocking** - We don't bang on the door, we ring the bell gently
- **Smart Delays** - Because patience is a virtue (and avoids timeouts)
- **Fingerprint Shuffle** - Looking different every time we visit
- **Human Impersonation** - Acting like a regular browser, not a data vacuum

## Installation - The Not-So-Scary Part 🛠️

### You'll Need:
- Java 17 or newer (the cool kids' version)
- Internet connection (surprise!)
- Curiosity (mandatory)

### Quick Start Magic:
```bash
# Clone this digital masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/hangga/Wayback-GUI.git
cd WaybackGUI
```

### For IDE Enjoyers:
1. Open in your favorite Java IDE
2. Add FlatLaf (the thing that makes it pretty)
3. Hit run and watch the magic happen

## How to Use Without Breaking Things 🎮

### Basic Operation for Humans:
1. **Open the app** (the hardest part)
2. **Type a domain** - you know, like "example.com"
3. **Pick your poison** - choose from our 10 exciting modes
4. **Click the shiny button** - and watch the internet history unfold

### What All These Modes Actually Do:

| Mode | Translation | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Main Domain | "Show me everything" | First date with a domain |
| 2. Wildcard Domain | "Also your cousins" | Family reunion mode |
| 3. Specific Path | "Just the living room" | When you know what you want |
| 4. Sensitive Files | "Where you hide the cookies" | Treasure hunt |

### Pro Tips (Because You're Special):
- **Proxy Mode**: For when you want to bring wingmen
- **Stealth Settings**: Making your requests look accidental
- **Smart Timing**: Because servers have feelings too

## What You Might Find 🎁

### Typical Results:
```
▸ Found: example.com/config.json (oops)
▸ Found: example.com/backup_2023.sql (double oops)
▸ Found: admin.example.com/login.php (classic)
▸ Found: api.example.com/users.json (the good stuff)
```

### The Tool Also Thinks For You:
- "Hey, this looks like a config file!"
- "This might be important (or not)"
- "Here's how much digital baggage this domain has"

## Technical Stuff (For the Nerds) 🔧

### How We Stay Polite:
- **Rotating Identities** - Different browsers, different times
- **Strategic Waiting** - Not too eager, not too lazy
- **Gentle Persistence** - If at first you don't succeed, wait a bit and try again

### Under the Hood:
- **Stream Processing** - Handles data like a gentle stream, not a firehose
- **Memory Friendly** - Won't eat all your RAM (probably)
- **Error Handling** - For when the internet is being the internet

## Important Legal-ish Stuff ⚖️

### Cool Uses:
- Research (the good kind)
- Learning how websites change over time
- Finding your own old websites (digital nostalgia)
- Authorized security testing (with permission slips)

### Not-So-Cool Uses:
- Being a digital creeper
- Breaking things that aren't yours
- Annoying server administrators
- Generally being a nuisance

### Be a Good Internet Citizen:
If you find something sensitive:
1. Don't be weird about it
2. Tell the right people (nicely)
3. Don't exploit it for evil
4. Remember: with great power comes great responsibility (yes, I went there)

## When Things Go Weird 🐛

### Common "Oops" Moments:

**Server Says "Slow Down!"**
- Turn on proxy mode
- Take a coffee break between requests
- Try again later (servers need naps too)

**Nothing Happening?**
- Check your internet (the classic)
- Make sure Java is awake
- Verify you typed the domain right

**Weird Characters?**
- That's just the tool speaking archive language
- We handle compression like pros

### Performance Pro-tips:
- Specific modes = faster results
- Proxies = happier servers
- Patience = virtue (and better data)
